# YAGI
## What is it?
Yagi is a special type addition to a dipole (lambda/2) antenna, which has got additional directors and a reflector along with it to improve gain. From different case studies yagi's advantages are its area and weight, or lack therof.  
## P2P? how?
P2P means point to point, for extreme long distance (order of kilometers) the need of directional antenas pointing at each other is required. Now the first problem,  
Pointing, the angle ar which each other are oriented matters in the case of these antennas. Although the bigger the wavelength, the wider the beam, the longer it travels, which equals to the narrower the wavelength, the sharper the beam, the shorter it travels (buckshot vs slug).
## Constraints.
The biggest constraint in using this antenna in our designs is the impedance matching and balanced feeding. Both of which add certain losses and add complexity to the system. 
## Benefits.
For shorter wavelength say more than 2.4 gigs, PCB antennas could be made and matching and coupling can be made onto the pcb using simple components. For longer wavelenghts, the problem of providiing support and strength the construction comes into play.
